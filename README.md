# Pika 
This is a simple console application meant to allow syncing of certain directories between
multiple computers. This was built to solve a recurring and annoying issue of mine where I only having
certain code on certain computers. Github is a great way to solve this problem, but I have many
files that would not require a Github repo, so this solves more general file sync needs.

# Usage
`pika sync /path/to/dir`
